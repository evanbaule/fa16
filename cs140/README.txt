Each of these files was written to the specification  of Leslie Lander as assignments for course CS140: Programming With Objects

The course website with syllabus and information can be found here: http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~lander/cs140/

The files in this repository are the combination of work of the Binghamton University Computer Science 140 staff and myself, Evan M. Baule.

No assignments were uploaded until after they were submitted to the grading staff.

No other student has been (or will be) authorized to use this code for their own projects in CS140.
